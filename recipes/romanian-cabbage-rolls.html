        <h3><div class="a"><em>My recipe for traditional <strong>Romanian Cabbage Rolls or &quot;Sarmale&quot;</strong> are made with sour
            cabbage stuffed with pork, beef, and little bit of bacon. They're the best cabbage rolls you will ever have!</em></h4>
        </strong></em></div></h3>
        <p><div class="a">This recipe for Romanian cabbage rolls is tried and true. I've made it probably a hundred times, and have rolled thousands of them! The big difference between Romanian 
            cabbage rolls and others are that we make them with <strong>sour cabbage</strong>. You can find cabbage at pretty much all grocery stores sold in jars. 
            You can also find sour cabbage at your local Polish or Ukrainian stores!</div></p>
        <p><div class="a">This is my mom's recipe and it's my favorite. I won't eat cabbage rolls made any other way. The other piece that separates Romanian cabbage rolls from the rest is that we add some kind of smoked meat.
             This time I used <strong>smoked bacon</strong>. Now I've got your attention, hey?</div></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <p>  <div class="a">
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Vetetable oil - </strong>We'll be using this to saute the onion and rice. You can use any type of oil that you have handy</li>
                <li><strong>Onion - </strong>I used a large onion because this recipe makes a lot of cabbage rolls. Every bite should have onion in it!</li>
                <li><strong>Long grain rice - </strong>Basmati rice is best. I wouldn't use brown rice - it take a lot longer to cook than white rice and you way end up with crunchy bits in your rolls</li>
                <li><strong>Ground pork - </strong>I love to use pork because it has a higher fat content and makes for some nice juicy rolls. You can use any type of ground meat you like, but keep in mind that leaner meats like chicken or turkey will come out drier.</li>
                <li><strong>Fresh parsley & dill - </strong>Using fresh herbs makes such a big difference in how the flavor develops in your rolls!</li>
                <li><strong>Salt & Pepper - </strong>Season the mixture to your own discretion</li>
                <li><strong>Sour cabbage leaves - </strong>This is what really sets the Romanian version apart from the rest. The little hit of vinegar is to die for!</li>
                <li><strong>Bacon - </strong>Find yourself a nice thick-cut smoky style of bacon.</li>
                <li><strong>Tomato Juice - </strong>This is what our rolls are going to sit and cook in.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>How to Make Romanian Cabbage Rolls</h3>
        <p><div class="a"> 
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the filling: </strong>Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high. Saute the onions until translucent, then add the rice and toast for 1 minute. Add the pork, salt, pepper, parsley, dill, and the onion mixture to a large bowl and mix well. Use salt sparingly; the cabbage leaves are brined.</li>
                <li><strong>Roll the filling: </strong>Remove the cabbage leaves from the brine. You can soak them in water beforehand to draw out some of the salt. Cut each leaf in half and fill the piece with a few tbsp of the meat mixture and roll. Refer to the video in the recipe card to see how I roll these nice and tight. Repeat until all the filling has been used.</li>
                <li><strong>Assemble the rolls: </strong>Chop up the remaining cabbage leaves and add them to a large pot or deep roasting dish with a lid. Arrange all the rolls over the chopped cabbage and disperse the bacon evenly among the rolls. Pour the tomato juice over the rolls and top up with some water, if needed, to ensure the rolls are covered with liquid.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake the rolls: </strong>Cover the pot with a lid or foil. Bake at 375F for 2 hours, then remove the cover and cook for another 1 1/2 - 2 hours. Serve hot with a side of sour cream.</li>
            </ol>
