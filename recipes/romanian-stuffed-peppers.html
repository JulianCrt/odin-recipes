        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <h3>Peppers</h3>
        <p> <div class="a">
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Peppers - </em></strong>We are using medium sized Hungarian yellow sweet peppers but
                                                        if you can find any regular yellow bell peppers will work just fine</li>
                <li><strong><em>Pork - </em></strong>We are looking for ground pork, as fat as possible. The reason for this
                                                     is so that our meat in the stuffed peppers is nice and juicy and not hard like a brick.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Rice - </em></strong>Use any kind you'd like just be sure it's uncooked. I usually prefer to use a long grain rice.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Onion - </em></strong>Chopped up, be sure to look for something that cooks down well like white or yellow onion.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Egg - </em></strong>This will bind all of our filling ingredients together nicely.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Herbs - </em></strong>Fresh dill and parsley chopped up fine. The more fresh dill the better. Trust me on this one.</li>
                <li><strong><en>Seasoning - </en></strong>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Sauce</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong><em>Tomato - </em></strong>Either puree and passata either can be used interchangeably in this recipe</li>
                <li><strong><em>Sour Cream - </em></strong>Just a dollop of this will add some creamy tang to our dish.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Water - </em></strong>To thin out our sauce and give us a better consistency.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Seasoning - </em></strong>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>How To Make Romanian Stuffed Peppers</h3>
        <p><div class="a">
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Preheat your oven: </strong>Arrange a rack in the middle of your oven and preheat to 375F degrees.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the peppers: </strong>Prepare the peppers by cutting off the tops of the peppers. Remove and 
                            discard any seeds and membranes from the insides of the peppers. To keep the peppers from falling over 
                            while cooking, cut a small flat piece off the bottom of the pepper so that it has a more even bottom 
                            and they'll stand up nicely.</li>
                <li><strong>Combine the filling: </strong>In a large bowl combine the ground pork, rice, onion, egg, dill, parsley,
                            salt and pepper. Mix well. Stuff each pepper really well and arrange them in a big pot standing up.</li>
                <li><strong>Prepare the sauce: </strong>To make the sauce whisk together the tomato puree with the sour cream, water,
                            salt and pepper. Pour this over the peppers. Add more water if needed, there should be enough water to 
                            come about half way up the peppers.</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the peppers: </strong>Cover the pot with a lid or aluminum foil and bake for 1 1/2 hours covered.
                            Remove the lid and continue baking for another 45 minutes to an hour uncovered. The peppers are ready 
                            when you insert a fork in a pepper and it goes easy through the skin of the pepper and meat, and the rice is cooked.</li>
                <li><strong>Finish the dish: </strong>Serve these hot with lots of sauce and a dollop of sour cream on top, along side some crusty 
                            bread for dipping in the sauce.</li>
            </ol>
