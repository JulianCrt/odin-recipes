        <h3><div class="a"><em>I always love sharing my Romanian recipes with you all because making them really takes me back to my childhood. This one is nostalgia more than any I've shared before 
            because this delicious Meatball soup is one my mom would make most often. It's a favorite whenever I make it here at home because it's super flavorful, 
            chock full of tart lemon, herby meatballs, and rich tomato broth.</em></div></h3>
        <p><div class="a">In Romanian we call these types of soups &quot;ciorba&quot;. &quot;Ciorba&quot; in Romanian usually refers to sour soups with vegetables and some form of meat. 
                          They are made sour by adding either lemon juice, &quot;bors&quot; which is fermented wheat bran, sauerkraut juice, or sometimes even vinegar. &quot;Ciorba de perisoare&quot; basically means meatball soup.</div></p>
        <p><div class="a">When it comes to this soup  I just use lemon juice and this gives the soup a <strong>very nice</strong> sour taste. The meatballs are quite simple and although I used pork in these recipe, <strong>any type</strong> of ground meat will work.
                          I've made them with ground beef, ground beef, or even ground chicken or turkey, you could even mix the meats.</div></p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <h4>Meatballs</h4>
            <ul><div class="a">

                <li><strong><em>Egg - </em></strong>The binder for our meatballs.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Herbs - </em></strong>Chopped fresh parsley and dill</li>
                <li><strong><em>Rice - </em></strong>Long grain and uncooked. This will add some great chew to our meatballs.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Seasoning - </em></strong>Salt and pepper.</li>

            </div></ul>
        <h4>Soup</h4>
            <ul><div class="a">
                <li><strong><em>Olive oil - </em></strong>We want a nice neutral tasting oil for this soup.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Veggies - </em></strong>Carrots, onion, and celery as our mirepoix, aka dish base.</li>
                <li><strong><em>Tomato paste - </em></strong>This will make up our part of our flavor base for this hearty soup.

                                                       can be used in its place</li>

        <h3>How To Make Romanian Meatball Soup</h3>
        <ol><div class="a">
            <li><strong>Form the meatballs: </strong>In a bowl add all the meatball ingredients together and mix well. Shape into meatballs about 1 inch in diameter, you should get about 30 to 35 meatballs depending on how big you make them. 
                        Place meatballs in fridge until ready to add to soup.</li>
            <li><strong>Create the soup base: </strong>Heat the olive oil in a heavy bottom 5 qt pot to medium heat. Add the onions, carrots and celery to the pot and cook for about 5 minutes or until the onions soften and are translucent.
                        Season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li><strong>Form the soup broth: </strong>Stir in the tomato paste, then add the chicken broth and water then bring to a boil and add the meatballs one at a time. Cook for about 10 minutes or until the meatballs are cooked through,
                        they will rise to the top when they are done. Season with vegeta then add the lemon juice and lovage.</li>
            <li><strong>Finish the soup: </strong>Taste for salt and pepper and adjust as necessary. Very slowly pour in the egg in a steady stream. To make shreds, stir the egg rapidly in a clockwise direction for one minute. 
                        Cook for another minute then garnish with parsley.</li>
